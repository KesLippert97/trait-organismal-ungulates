# Terms
Description of some of the terms used in the dataset. The terms contain the name, definition and units in which the value is measured. When the values are categorical, the different categories are listed.

## MaturityReachFemale
- The months needed for a female animal of the species to reach sexual maturity.
- Months

## MaturityReachMale
- The months needed for a male animal of the species to reach sexual maturity.

## NaturalPredators
- Whether the species has natural predators in their natural habitat (not counting humans). They were defined as (1) having less than 3 natural predators (including 3), (2) having more than 3 natural predators or (3) not having natural predators.
#### _Less than 3_
#### _More than 3_
#### _None_

## NumMales
- The number of mature males in a group of species. They were defined as (1) multiple males per social group (2) one male per social group (3) no males per social group / males live separately or (4) there is no social group / the species is solitary.
