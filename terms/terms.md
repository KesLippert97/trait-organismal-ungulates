# Terms
Description of some of the terms used in the dataset. The terms contain the name, definition and units in which the value is measured. When the values are categorical, the different categories are listed.

## Family
Definiton: The taxonomic rank Family.

## Genus
- The taxonomic rank Genus.

## Horns/Antlers
- Whether only the male mature species has horns/antlers, only the female mature species has horns/antlers both male and female mature species have horns/antlers or both male and female species don't have horns/antlers.
- The species were defined as to which gender has horns/antlers:
#### _Male_ (1)

- The way the species group is structured in relation to sexual behaviour. 
- The species' mating systems were defined as:
#### _Monogamy_ (1)
#### _Polyandry_ (2)
#### _Polygyny_ (3)
#### _Polygynandry_ (4)

## MaturityReachFemale
- The months needed for a female animal of the species to reach sexual maturity.
- Months

## MaturityReachMale
- The months needed for a male animal of the species to reach sexual maturity.
- Months

## Motility
- Ability to move spontaneously and actively, using metabolic energy. 
- The species were defined as:
#### _Actively mobile_ (1)
#### _Facultatively mobile_ (2)
#### _Fast moving_ (3)

## NaturalPredators
- Whether the species has natural predators in their natural habitat (not counting humans). 
- The species were defined as having:
#### _Less than 3 (incl 3)_ (1)
#### _More than 3_ (2)
#### _None_ (3)

## NumMales
- The number of mature males in a group of species. There could be multiple males per social group, one male per social group, no males per social group/males live separatly or there is no social group/the species lives solitary.
- The species were defined as amount of males per group:
#### _Multiple males_ (1)
#### _One male_ (2)

- The species were defined as: 
#### _Parents care for offspring_ (1)
#### _Parents don't care for offspring_ (2)

## PullStrength
- The amount of grams a mature species can pull (Same as carry weight, 20% of the mature animal's body weight).
- Grams

## SocialHierarchy
- Whether there is a social hierarchy or not. 
- The species were defined as 
#### _Social hierarchy_ (1) 
#### _No social hierarchy_ (2)

## Sociality
- The degree to which the species tend to associate in social groups.
