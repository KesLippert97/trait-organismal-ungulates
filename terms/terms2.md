# Terms
Description of some of the terms used in the dataset. The terms contain the name, definition and units in which the value is measured. When the values are categorical, the different categories are listed. 


# AVGBodyMass
- The average amount of matter in the body of an adult animal of the species.
- Kilograms

# AVGFoodConsumption
- The average amount of food the mature species eats in a day.
- Kilograms

# AVGMovingSpeed
- The average amount of kilometers per hour a mature species can run. Top speed is used instead when information about the average moving speed cannot be found.
- Kilometers/hour

# AVGTravelDistance
- The average amount of kilometers a mature species can walk/run per day. The size of the home range is used when information about the average travel distance cannot be found.
- Kilometers

# AVGWeight
- The amount of kilograms the mature species weighs on average.
- Kilograms

# Binomial Name
- The name of the organism, consisting of 2 terms in Latin: the first being the genus and the second being the species.


# BreedingInterval
- Average number of days between two gestation periods.
- Days

# CarryWeight
- The average number of grams a mature species can carry. (For the purposes of this paper it is measured as 20% of the mature animal's body weight)
- Grams 

# DevelopmentStrategy
- Whether the offspring needs the help of the parents to survive, or they can do it by themselfs. The species were defined as (1) precocial or (2) altricial.


# Diet
- What kind of food the animal eats. Species were defined as (1) frugivores, (2) granivores, (3) nectivores, (4) folivores, (5) lignivores or (6) multiple kinds.


# Domestication
- Whether the animal is domesticated or the wild ancestor of a domesticated species or not. Species were defined as (1) domesticated or (2) wild.
Unit: -

# Family
Definiton: The taxonomic rank Family.


# Genus
- The taxonomic rank Genus.


# Horns/Antlers
- Whether (1) only the male mature species has horns/antlers, (2) only the female mature species has horns/antlers (3) both male and female mature species have horns/antlers or (4) both male and female species don't have horns/antlers.


# ID_EoL
- The IDs from the Encyclopedia of Life database.


# Lifespan
- The average number of years the species lives.
- Years

# MatingSystem
- The way the species group is structured in relation to sexual behaviour. The species' mating systems were defined as (1) monogamy, (2) polyandry, (3) polygyny and (4) polygynandry.


# MaturityReachFemale
- The months needed for a female animal of the species to reach sexual maturity.
- Months

# MaturityReachMale
- The months needed for a male animal of the species to reach sexual maturity.
- Months

# Motility
- Ability to move spontaneously and actively, using metabolic energy. The species were defined as (1) actively mobile, (2) facultatively mobile or (3) fast moving.




# NaturalPredators
- Whether the species has natural predators in their natural habitat (not counting humans). They were defined as (1) having less than 3 natural predators (including 3), (2) having more than 3 natural predators or (3) not having natural predators.


# NumMales
- The number of mature males in a group of species. They were defined as (1) multiple males per social group (2) one male per social group (3) no males per social group / males live separatly or (4) there is no social group / the species is solitary.


# NumOffspring
- The average amount of offspring per pregnancy.
- Count

# Order
- The taxonomic rank Order.


# ParentalCare
- Whether the parents care for and rear the offspring or not. The species were defined as (1) parents care for offspring and (2) parents don't care for offspring.


# PullStrength
- The amount of grams a mature species can pull (Same as carry weight, 20% of the mature animal's body weight).
- Grams

# SocialHierarchy
- Whether there is a social hierarchy or not. They were defined as (1) social hierarchy or (2) no social hierarchy.


# Sociality
- The degree to which the species tend to associate in social groups. Species were defined as (1) solitary or (2) in a group.


# Species
- The taxonomic rank Species.


# YearRoundBreeding
- Whether the species breeds (1) all year round or (2) seasonal.
