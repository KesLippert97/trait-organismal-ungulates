### Domesticated (1)
### Wild (2)

## Family
Definiton: The taxonomic rank Family.

## Genus
- The taxonomic rank Genus.

## Horns/Antlers
- Whether only the male mature species has horns/antlers, only the female mature species has horns/antlers both male and female mature species have horns/antlers or both male and female species don't have horns/antlers.

## NumMales
- The number of mature males in a group of species. There could be multiple males per social group, one male per social group, no males per social group/males live separatly or there is no social group/the species lives solitary.
