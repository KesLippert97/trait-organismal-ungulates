                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Two isolated populations of European bison (<span rank="Species" class="taxon-link rank-species">Bison bonasus</span>), also known as wisent or European wood bison, occur in the Bialowieza forest. Since World War II, populations have been divided by international borders. European bison herds, scattered across Central and Eastern Europe, represent two genetic lines: the lowland line (Poland, Belarus, and Lithuania) and the lowland-Caucasian line (southern Poland, Russia, Ukraine and Slovakia). Historically European bison were found in all lowlands of Europe extending from the Pyrenees to Southern Sweden and the Caucasus. All wild populations of European bison went extinct due to overhunting and habitat loss. Captive bison were bred and reintroduced and have since increased to approximately 3000 animals, 1500 of which occur in about 30 free ranging herds. <span class="citations"> (<a href="#5531D923-A3A8-11E2-BF3D-002500F14F28" class="citation">Krasinska, et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#BB7850CA-A3A6-11E2-B528-002500F14F28" class="citation">Kuemmerle, et al., 2011</a>)</span></p>

                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">European Bison are commonly found in broad-leaved or mixed forests in a mosaic-type landscape. Deciduous forest types tend to be the most favorable. All European bison populations inhabit ranges that include open areas, such as mown meadows, deforested glades covered with grass, clear cuts, and young plantations up to ten years old. Lowland forests tend to be dominated by oak and mixed oak-pine forests. In some sites, fir and beech stands with a considerable mixture of spruce dominate bison habitat. In all bison ranges, damages to agricultural crops have been reported to reveal the presence of herds in agricultural-dominated landscapes <span class="citations"> (<a href="#7ED75233-A3A7-11E2-B348-002500F14F28" class="citation">Kuemmerle, et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#BB7850CA-A3A6-11E2-B528-002500F14F28" class="citation">Kuemmerle, et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#16E7FFAB-A3AA-11E2-A7E5-002500F14F28" class="citation">NA, 2012</a>)</span></p>

                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">European bison are the largest native herbivores in Europe. Their appearance is very similar to North American bison although they are smaller in stature and have a longer mane on the forehead and beneath the neck. The coat is also less shaggy than <a class="taxon-link" href="/accounts/Bison_bison/">American bison</a> and varies in color from golden brown to dark brown. European bison reach a length of about 2.9 meters and a height of about 1.8 to 1.95 meters. They typically weigh from 800 to 1,000 kg. The hump formed by spinal processes of the thoracic vertebrae surrounded by powerful muscles is more developed in males than female bison. Sexual dimorphism becomes pronounced at age three and extends throughout life. <span class="citations"> (<a href="#16E7FFAB-A3AA-11E2-A7E5-002500F14F28" class="citation">NA, 2012</a>)</span></p>

                  <h3 id="reproduction">Reproduction</h3>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">In the pre-rutting period (July through October), reproductively active bulls are rarely present in the group. During this period, sexually active bulls display limited sexual behavior such as sniffing external sexual organs of cows and flehmen. Starting in July, reproductively active bulls join mixed herds with cows. Smaller groups are typically made up of 10 to 12 individuals typically including only one adult bull more than six years of age (sexually mature) and 1 to 3 bulls that do not take part in reproduction. In large groups there may be more than one bull, which intensifies sexual behavior of bulls in the rutting period. If a group is approached by another sexually mature bull during the rutting period, the dominant bull may fight. In the presence of a cow in rut, the dominant bull will approach her and isolate her from the group accompanying her while hardly eating and resting. This is known as a tending bond. The bull will accompany the cow until copulation occurs. <span class="citations"> (<a href="#B0D3633A-A3A4-11E2-918C-002500F14F28" class="citation">Krasinski and Raczynski, 1967</a>)</span></p>

                  <h3 id="behavior">Behavior</h3>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Daily activity of European bison is typical of ruminants with phases of foraging, alternating with resting and rumination. During the summer, bison spend 60% of their daily activity on feeding, 30% on resting, and the remaining 10% on roaming without feeding. In the winter, European bison are typically supplemented with hay and spend 30% of their activity feeding and 60% roaming. Herds typically include mixed groups containing cows, young aged 2 to 3, calves, and adult bulls as well as bull groups. The size of mixed groups is environment-dependent and on average consists of 8 to 13 animals. Sometimes European bison foraging in open areas form larger groups of 23 individuals. Bull groups are always small usually composing of 2 animals on average while greater than half of the bulls lead a solitary life. Groups of European bison are not family units and the size and structure of mixed groups change because of seasonal or behavioral reasons (calving, joining bulls in the rutting period). Young bulls move between groups most frequently. Movement across habitats is correlated with feeding activity and food supply. In winter, the majority of bison gather around feeding sites and form large mixed aggregations. <span class="citations"> (<a href="#4828C97D-AD2E-11E2-9D60-002500F14F28" class="citation">Pucek, et al., 2003</a>)</span></p>

                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">In winters of continuous snow cover, European bison are supplemented hay offered in racks. During this time, their basic food consists of 90.4% grasses, sedges and herbs, with 9.5% trees and shrubs as supplementary food. In the spring the bison eat 88.2% grasses, sedges, and herbs and 11.2% trees and shrubs. In the summer their diet consists of grasses, sedges, and herbs and 13% trees and shrubs. In Autumn, 93.2% grasses, sedges and herbs and 6.7% trees and shrubs make up their diet. Mosses, horsetails, fens and fungi combined account for 0.1 to 0.7% of the rumen capacity, depending on the season. In some conditions, trees are preferred and when supplementary hay is provided, the bison continue to eat twigs and bark. In combination, European bison feed principally on grasses, sedges, and herbs (about 90% of their diet) and supplement it with tree food (about 10% of their diet). <span class="citations"> (<a href="#5A481D80-A3A9-11E2-A5CA-002500F14F28" class="citation">Gebczynska, et al., 1991</a>)</span></p>

                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Supplementary feeding is used in the management of European Bison in order to prevent environmental damage, particularly damage to commercial and native forests. Foresters are largely convinced that these bison have a destructive impact on tree stands. Bison however are physiologically adapted to grazing rather than browsing. Foraging by large herbivores like the European bison can regulate both the recruitment and composition of tree stands in temperate forests. In untouched forests, an abundance of ungulates can result in a greater density of forest regeneration and well as an increase in biodiversity. European bison are important dispersal agents of seeds in forest ecosystems; around 178 vascular plant species are dispersed by bison. Bison can also be responsible for the spread of invasive species in forests most likely consumed through supplemental feeding. <span class="citations"> (<a href="#D4F6E6F3-A3A3-11E2-AEB3-002500F14F28" class="citation">Jaroszewicz, et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#2B6FD54A-A3A4-11E2-B287-002500F14F28" class="citation">Kowalczyk, et al., 2011</a>)</span></p>

                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Ecotourism can be used to create additional opportunities for long-term local profits especially in areas with high crop depredation by the European bison. Around 140,000 visitors come to the Bialowieza forest each year to see the bison which is becoming a driver of local development. Although foresters are convinced that bison may damage important commercial tree stands, bison mainly impact tree species of lower economic value, making their impact insignificant in the forest. The species of trees consumed by bison are very different than the species used in timber exploitation. <span class="citations"> (<a href="#9539ABE3-A3A5-11E2-8063-002500F14F28" class="citation">Hoffman-Kaminska and Kowalczyk, 2012</a>; <a href="#2B6FD54A-A3A4-11E2-B287-002500F14F28" class="citation">Kowalczyk, et al., 2011</a>)</span></p>

                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">In many parts of the world, large wild herbivores can have a major impact on the environment and contribute to many wildlife-human conflicts. Large ungulates, such as European bison, often encounter conflicts with domestic animals over space and food and can cause crop depredation as well as the transmission of diseases. With urbanization, habitat fragmentation, and habitat in proximity to human settlements and farms, it is difficult for large ungulates of the world to be managed for human-wildlife conflict. About 70% of European bison that were reintroduced to forest habitat have expanded into open oftentimes agriculture habitat. Supplementary feeding and culling of the herd is used by managers to keep bison in forest habitat and minimize damage to agriculture and tree stands. In 2010, just over 90,000 Euros were paid to farmers in compensation for crop damage by bison, and that number continues to rise each year. Despite efforts to compensate farmers, the reintroduction of bison and their continued presence is not fully accepted by local communities. As European bison continue to expand, human-bison conflict is expected to increase in the future. In countries such as Belarus, Russia and Ukraine where bison crop depredation exists and compensation is not offered to farmers, there is general low acceptance of the European bison and sometimes a decline in its population due to uncontrolled hunting and poaching. <span class="citations"> (<a href="#9539ABE3-A3A5-11E2-8063-002500F14F28" class="citation">Hoffman-Kaminska and Kowalczyk, 2012</a>)</span></p>

                  <h3 id="conservation_status">Conservation Status</h3>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">There are two genetic lines of European bison, the lowland line (<span rank="Species" class="taxon-name rank-species">B. b. bonasus</span>) and the lowland-Caucasian line (<span rank="Species" class="taxon-name rank-species">B. b. caucasicus</span> and <span rank="Species" class="taxon-name rank-species">B. b. bonasus</span>). The lowland line is listed as Vulnerable D1 under the IUCN Red list and is currently increasing. The lowland-Caucasian line is listed as Endangered C1+2a. All subpopulations of this line have fewer than 250 individuals. European bison are an excellent example of the way in which a species can be brought to the brink of extinction in a short period and then saved through great efforts. Threats to European bison include habitat fragmentation due to agricultural activity, logging, and unlimited hunting and poaching. The over-population of deer species and the reduction of natural food resources for herbivores is likely the cause of some population declines at the beginning of the 19th century. Inbreeding depression, disease, hybridization, and poaching continue to threaten reintroduced herds. After passing through a genetic bottleneck with just 12 founder individuals of the current population, the gene pool of current bison populations is very limited and they are highly inbred. The negative effects of their genetics include a lowered reproduction rate, a harmful effect on skeleton growth, and a lowered immune resistance against disease and pathogens. Hybridization with American bison has occurred in herds in the Caucasus Mountains, especially in close proximity to reintroduced pure lowland-Caucasian line bison herds. Fear of hybridization between the two herds continues. The failure of enforcing conservation laws and a general dislike of the reintroduced bison because of crop depredation has contributed to an increase in poaching as well.
