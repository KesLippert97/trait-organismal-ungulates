# CSV data files

The CSV folder contains the ungulate trait data and the trait definitions, both in comma-seperated file form. 
- [Trait data](ungulatesTraits.csv)
- [Trait definitions](ungulatesTraitsDefinitions.csv)

The relevant variables in the trait data were chosen with the help of literature study, and the PanTHERIA, EoL and
ADW databases. There are a couple of trait categories in which the hypothesized predictor variables are found: diet, growth rate, 
mating procedure, nervousness, nature and social structure. From these categories, measurable traits were formulated. These
selected traits were merged with traits from the [PanTHERIA data file](https://github.com/naturalis/trait-organismal-ungulates/blob/master/data/PanTHERIA.tsv) and ecological 
traits collected by Elke Hendrix (which can be found here: https://github.com/naturalis/trait-geo-diverse-ungulates/blob/master/results/OMI/niche_traits.csv).
